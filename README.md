# quik_view

Quikr Hackathon Repository.

This is a data visualzation application for Quikr. We have used their Developer API.

Technical Details
=================

This application uses Bootstrap for front-end and Django Framework for backend. We have written a wrapper for Quikr API in Python and exposed it using Django. We have also used multiple Javascript Libraries including Google Maps JS API, D3 (Data Driven Documents) and JQuery Framework.
